## Project Overview
Using SQL to analyze retail sales, customer behaviour, and product performance within an e-commerce database.  

The dataset includes four main tables:
- **Customer** – customer demographic and contact information  
- **Orders** – transaction details and dates  
- **OrderItem** – product quantity and sales per order  
- **Product** – product details such as size, variety, and status  

Each query demonstrates essential SQL data-analysis techniques — including filtering, joins, aggregation, and CTEs — to extract actionable business insights.
